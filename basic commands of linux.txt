1) ~ (tilde): Home Directory of current user.

2) PWD (print working directory)   : Absoulute / Current Path

3) '/'  : Root/ Base Path

4)CD     : The cd command stands for change directory; with this, you can change your location and move to another directory.

5) '.'   : Current Directory

6) '..'  : Previous Directory

7) TOUCH : File creating-There are multiple ways of creating new files in the Linux terminal. The cat command you saw above can also create new files.

8) MKDIR : 	Make new directory-While there is no specific command for creating new files, 
		there is a dedicated command for making new folders (or directories, as we call them in Linux

9) ls	 : list of files and folders
   ls -l : 	You can use the long listing option ls -l to see details like file size, permission, 
		modified time, etc. You can sort and control these options if you want to.

10) rm	 : delete-You use the rm (short for remove) command to delete files in the Linux terminal.s

11) rm -r or rmdir : delete directory

15) cat	: file data

16) mv	: moveThe mv command stands for ‘move’. When you copy a file to another location, it remains in its original place.

	The mv command moves the files and folders to the other location. You can think of it as a cut-paste operation.

User add File permission + Owner ships:

how to create a non-root user?

useradd command:  useradd username
passwd username: to set password for user
user mode: sudo usermod -g groupname new_user


how to Login as non-root user in terminal:
su username

how to check which user owns the directory and other information about directory or file:
ls -l

how to change owner of the file:
sudo chown username file/directory name

How to Change a File’s Group Setting on Linux
If you are the owner of a file, you can change its group settings to any existing group. If you are not the owner, you will need root or sudo privileges.



chgrp <groupname> <file or directory>

How to Change a File’s Owner and Group at the Same Time
If you need to modify both the owner and group settings of a file or directory,
 you can do so with a single command. Since it involves changing the owner, you will need to have superuser privileges.

sudo chown <newowner>:<newgroup> <file or directory>


To add a new group to the system, use the groupadd command.
sudo groupadd <groupname>

To make sure your group has been created, you can use the getent command to list all groups or combine it with grep to look for a specific group.
getent group
getent group | grep <groupname>



How to Add a User to a Group on Linux
Adding a user to a group is accomplished with the usermod command. Again, you will need superuser privileges, 
and both the user and the group must already exist. The following command will add a user to a group:

sudo usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>


The -a switch in the command above stands for append and is important. If you add a user to a group without using the -a flag, the user will be removed from any other groups that they may already be part of. 
The -G flag signifies that you want to add the user to the group name following the switch.


How to Remove a User From a Group
Removing a user from a group is done with the gpasswd command. Enter the command (using sudo) in the following format.

sudo gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>


How to Remove a Group Using the Linux Terminal
Finally, the last thing you’ll need to know to manage groups on your system is to remove a group. First, 
it’s important to note that a group must be empty. If the group you want to remove is small, you can use the command above to manually remove each member.

If the group has more than just a handful of members and you need to remove them before deleting the group, 
you can remove them all at once with the groupmems command. Enter the command with the following format to remove all users from a specific group:

sudo groupmems -p -g <groupname>














	  

chmod: chmod o+r -R foldername, chmod o-r -R foldername,

chmod u+rwx -R directory_name
chmod g+wx -R directory_name
chmod o+wx -R directory_name
chmod u-rwx -R directory_name
chmod g-rwx -R directory_name
chmod o-rwx -R directory_name
chmod u-w -R directory_name
